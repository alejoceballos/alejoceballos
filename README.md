### I'm an Argentinian ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· naturalized Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, living in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ with more than two decades developing software professionally.

## About me:
I'm quite simple and direct. Today I focus my career on Java technologies, especially for the back-end and preferably with Spring and, of course, related infrastructure technologies. Any professional path other than this is outside my profile and is not of immediate interest. I've worked a lot with front-end technologies and various JavaScript frameworks/libraries, but this has been a long time ago, and it's not my strong point. I'm studying microservices, cloud, Kafka and so on, but between day-to-day work and study priorities focused on my work tasks, I haven't had as much time as I would like. In short, I have no practical experience (or that is valid as a professional) with Cloud and Kubernetes technologies. I worked a lot with relational databases and very little with NoSQL. I work with Docker, but I don't consider myself an expert on the subject.

Technical leadership roles are not outside my scope, but I believe this type of responsibility comes over time, within a team.

### About Java: 
Of my 25 years of professional life, approximately 9 have been dedicated to Java (yeah... There are a lot more techs and PLs, but out of scope right now), I have worked with the old Java 2, through 5 and 6 and today I work with versions 7, 8 and 11 professionally. I use Java 17 (started to fool around with 21) at home, in personal projects and studies. From Java EE I have already worked with Servlets, JSP and related topics (JSTL, Filters, etc.), today the web part is limited to Spring framework components. Regarding database access, I worked directly with JDBC and the main JPA implementation, Hibernate. I've worked with JMS for systems integration through asynchronous messages.

### About front-end: 
Although a little outdated, I've worked a lot with front-end in the past. Within Java technology, I worked with the good old JSP (JavaServer Pages), JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) and JSF (JavaServer Faces). As far as Javascript is concerned, in addition to jQuery, a long time ago I worked with Angular (in a currently outdated version). I spent a few years with Ember.js (more than I would like for a framework that I consider bureaucratic and not widely adopted by the front-end community) and a year with React (which I was most attracted to). Anyway... Front-end is not my strong point, though.

### What about full-stack? 
I don't believe in full-stack. That's it! I said it! Very few people are truly FULL-stack. Most of the time someone is strong in the back-end and has no fear of working with the front-end, or someone is strong in the front-end with little fear of the back-end. This gap becomes even more glaring when back-end and front-end technologies differ, add all CSS and related frameworks complexity and boom! Even people that works with front-end don't really understand CSS. Drawing a parallel, it's like looking for a neurosurgeon who has extreme expertise in cardiovascular surgeries and vice versa. They exist? Possibly, but very few.

### What about methodologies?

TBD (there is also a lot to say about this)
