#### I'm Argentine üá¶üá∑ naturalized Brazilian üáßüá∑, I live in Portugal üáµüáπ with more than two and a half decades developing software professionally.

## About me:

I'm quite simple and direct. Today I focus my career on Java technologies, mainly for back-end and preferably with Spring and, of course, related infrastructure technologies. Any professional path other than this is outside my professional scope and is not of immediate interest. I've worked a lot with front-end technologies and various JavaScript frameworks/libraries, but it's been a long time and it's not my strong point. I'm studying microservices, cloud, Kafka, etc., but between day-to-day work and study priorities focused on my work tasks, I haven't had as much time as I'd like. In short, I don't have any practical experience (or that is valid as a professional one) with Cloud and Kubernetes technologies. I worked a lot with relational databases and very little with NoSQL. I work with Docker, but I don't consider myself an expert on the subject.

Technical leadership roles are not outside my scope, but I believe that this type of responsibility comes with time, within a team, and not by falling from the sky as a technical leader on a project I've never worked with and with people I don't know and they don't know me.

### About Java:

From my 25+ years of professional career, more than 9 have been dedicated to Java (yes... I have worked with a ton of programming languages and other technologies, but that is out of scope at the moment, visit my LinkedIn page to find out more about it), I've worked with the old Java 2, up to 5 and 6 and today I work with versions 7, 8 and 11 professionally. I started playing with version 21 at home, on personal projects and studies. Love multi-threading and lambda functions along Java language debureaucratization like var declarations and records. From Java EE (Web) I have already worked with Servlets, JSP and related themes (JSTL, Filters, etc.), today the web part is limited to components of the Spring framework. Regarding database access, I worked directly with JDBC and the main JPA implementation, Hibernate. I also faced MyBatis on a few projects, but nothing too deep. Regarding messaging in Java, I worked with JMS to integrate systems through asynchronous messages.

### About front-end:

Although out of my current scope, I have worked a lot with front-end in the past. Within Java technology, I worked with the ‚Äúgood‚Äù old JSP (JavaServer Pages), JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) and JSF (JavaServer Faces). As far as Javascript is concerned, in addition to jQuery, I worked with Angular a long time ago (with a currently completely outdated version). I spent a few years with Ember.js (more than I would like for a framework that isn't widely adopted by the community) and a year with React (which appealed to me more). Anyway... Front-end is not my strong point.

### What about full-stack?

I don't believe in full-stack. That's it! I said that! But don't get me wrong, I believe that people can work with both front and back-end, but very few people are truly FULL-stack. Most of the time people are strong on the backend and have little fear of working with the frontend, or people are strong on the frontend with little fear of the backend. This gap becomes even more evident when backend and frontend technologies differ, add CSS, Node.js and related front-end frameworks and boom! In fact, I've also found good JavaScript professionals struggling with CSS. Making a comparison, it's like looking for a neurosurgeon who is an expert in cardiovascular surgeries and vice versa. They exist? Possibly, but very... Very few.

### And methodologies?

I love Agile! I started working in 1998. Using essential analytics with the old simple waterfall or spiral models was a must! So after some while I started using the great and powerful RUP (Rational Unified Process) and the beautiful UML. It was only in 2010 that I heard about Scrum and Agile, and suddenly it was the only thing allowed in the area of software development (thank God!) However, I have to be honest, in 15 years since I met agile, there were very few projects using true agile.

That's it! For more about my professional life, check at my LinkedIn page!

Cheers!
