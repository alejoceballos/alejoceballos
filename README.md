# About me

**I'm an [Argentinian](https://www.argentina.travel/) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· naturalized [Brazilian](https://visitbrasil.com/) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, living in 
[Portugal](https://www.visitportugal.com/) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ with more than two decades developing software professionally.**

## A quick Introduction:

I'm pretty simple and direct. Today, I focus my career on [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) 
technologies, mainly for the back end and preferably with Spring and, of course, related infrastructure technologies. 
Any professional path other than this is outside my professional scope and is not of immediate interest. I've worked 
extensively with front-end technologies and various [JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) 
frameworks/libraries. Still, it has been a long time since I delved into them, and lately, I've only kept in touch for 
small corrective and adaptive maintenance. I'm studying [microservices](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/), 
[cloud](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), etc., but I haven't 
had as much time as I'd like between day-to-day work and study priorities focused on my work tasks. In short, I don't 
have any practical experience (or that is valid as a professional one) with [Cloud](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) 
and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) technologies. I worked a lot with [relational databases](https://www.oracle.com/pt/database/what-is-a-relational-database/) 
and very little with [NoSQL](https://www.oracle.com/pt/database/nosql/what-is-nosql/). I usually work with 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/), but I don't consider myself an expert on the subject, 
although I can get by very well with it.

## What about Java?

From my almost 27 years of professional career, more than nine have been dedicated to 
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html). Yes... I have worked with a ton of programming 
languages and other technologies, but that is out of scope at the moment; visit my 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejoceballos/) page to find out more about it. I've worked with the old 
[Java 2](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/j2se-142.html), up to 5 and 6, and today, I work with versions 7, 8, 
and 11 professionally. I started messing around with version 21 on personal projects and studies at home. I love 
[multi-threading](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/multithreading.html), 
[lambda functions](https://dev.java/learn/lambdas/), and the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) 
language [debureaucratization](https://javatechonline.com/java-features-after-java-8/), such as var declarations and 
records. As of [Java EE](https://jakarta.ee/), I have already worked with [Servlets](https://www.baeldung.com/intro-to-servlets), 
[JSP](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jspt.html), and related themes ([JSTL](https://www.baeldung.com/jstl), 
[Filters](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/filters.html), etc.); today, the web part is limited to 
[Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) components. Regarding database access, I worked directly 
with [JDBC](https://www.baeldung.com/java-jdbc) and the main [JPA implementation, Hibernate](https://www.baeldung.com/learn-jpa-hibernate). 
I also encountered [JOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) and [MyBatis](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/) on a few projects, but 
nothing too deep. Regarding messaging in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html), I worked with 
JMS to integrate systems through asynchronous messages, but also worked a little bit with[IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/products/mq) 
and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

## What about the front end?

Although out of my current scope, I have worked a lot with the front end in the past. Within 
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) technology, I worked with the "good" old 
[JSP](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jspt.html) (JavaServer Pages), [JSTL](https://www.baeldung.com/jstl) 
(JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library), and [JSF](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javaserverfaces.html) 
(JavaServer Faces). As far as [JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is concerned, in addition to 
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/), I worked with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) long ago (with a currently outdated 
version). I spent a few years with [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) (more than I would like for a framework that isn't 
widely adopted by the community) and a year with [React](https://react.dev/) (which appealed to me more). Anyway... 
The front end is not my strong point, but I love [JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Have to 
start digging into [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), though.

## What about full stack?

Allow me to be dramatic... I don't believe in full-stack. That's it! I said it! But don't get me wrong, I do believe 
that people can work with both front and back end, but very few people are genuinely FULL stack (and I mean it... FEW!). 
Most of the time, people are strong on the back end and have little fear of working with the front end, or people are 
strong on the front end with little fear of the back end. This gap becomes even more evident when back-end and front-end 
technologies differ. Add [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and 
related front-end frameworks, and boom! You see a ton of alleged "full stack developers" creating so much macaroni code, 
trying to get coding standards from one layer to another instead of focusing on each layer separately. Truthfully, I 
also found good [JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) professionals struggling so much with 
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), which is all part of the front end, that now we have another 
professional layer, front-end designers, specialized in preventing developers from messing up with 
[usability](https://digital.gov/topics/usability/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and related 
stuff! Making a rough comparison is like looking for a neurosurgeon who is an expert in cardiovascular surgeries and 
vice versa. They exist? Possibly, but very... Very... Veeeeery few.

## What about software development processes and methodologies?

I love [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)! I started working in 1998 using essential analysis with the old simple 
[waterfall](https://instituteprojectmanagement.com/blog/waterfall-methodology/) or 
[spiral models](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/spiral-software-development-model). It was a must! So, after some while, I 
started using the great and powerful [RUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_unified_process) (Rational Unified 
Process) and the beautiful [UML](https://www.uml.org/what-is-uml.htm). It was only in 2010 that I heard about 
[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) and [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/), and suddenly, they 
were the only things allowed in software development (thank God!). However, I gotta be honest, in 15+ years since I met
[Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/), there have been very few projects using it as it should. You know, agile is not a 
thing that a team decides to do; it's a set of principles that must be embraced by the company, top-bottom. How many 
times I was forced to give an estimation... In weeks! Or break an unbreakable story in two "just to fit the sprint." 
Anyway, [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html) (Test-Driven Development), 
[BDD](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/) (Behavior-Driven development), 
[pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pair-programming/), fast feedback, total transparency... 
They are stuff that work in real life, you just have to make that leap of faith... If you dare!

## What about technical leadership?

Hey dude! 27 years in the market? Haven't you been promoted yet? (a.k.a. Technical Leadership).

Oh gosh, leadership! I have taken this toll many times in many projects and many companies. Technical leadership roles 
are not outside my scope, but I believe that this type of responsibility comes with time, working within a team, and not 
by falling from the sky as a technical leader on a project I've never worked with and with people I don't know, and they 
don't know me. Also, I **like to code** and design solutions and architectures and not spend endless time in meetings 
that, let's be honest, most of them could have been a simple email. C'mon! But I don't deny the absolute need for a 
leadership role; just let's stop lying and calling it "technical" leadership, okay? We need leaders who are not 
oblivious to the technology the team is working with and have very good soft skills. But please, when trying to 
"promote" someone to be a technical leader, tell this person the truth: You will not be coding again, perhaps some lines 
here and there, but not real hard coding.
